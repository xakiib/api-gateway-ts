The ***options*** object passed to this method configures how the middleware should behave and what proxy rules it should follow. Here are some common options which can be used with ***createProxyMiddleware***:

## target:
    This option sets the target host where we want to forward our incoming requests.
### changeOrigin:
    This option modifies the original request's Origin header to reflect the target URL.
### secure:
    This option determines whether to verify SSL certificates while forwarding requests.
### logLevel:
    This option sets the logging level (info, warn, error or debug) for the middleware.
### pathRewrite:
    This option allows us to rewrite parts of the incoming URL, helping us to clean up endpoints and forward the appropriate requests.
### router:
    This option allows us to programmatically decide which endpoint to use based on the incoming request path.
    There are several other options available as well, depending on the specific use case for the proxy server. Overall, these options make http-proxy-middleware a flexible tool for setting up a reverse proxy in a TypeScript app
